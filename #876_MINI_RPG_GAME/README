# Arena RPG (Python Mini‑Game)

A lightweight, text‑based arena battle game written in Python. Create your hero, face off against randomly generated enemies, and see how far you can climb through the arenas before you get overpowered.

## How to Play

1. **Run the game**

    ```bash
    python rpg_game.py
    ```

2. **Create your character**

    - Enter a name.
    - Your stats (health, attack, skill, defense, speed) are rolled randomly.

3. **Battle enemies**

    - Each arena level spawns a new enemy with scaled stats.
    - You’ll see your character’s health vs. the enemy’s health.
    - Choose whether to continue or flee.
    - Combat is turn‑based: the faster fighter attacks first.
    - Each attack has a hit chance based on the attacker’s skill.
    - Damage is calculated as `attack - defense`, with a minimum of 1.

4. **Level up**

    - Win a battle and your character’s stats may increase slightly.
    - Health is restored after each victory.

5. **Game over**
    - If your health drops to 0, the game ends and you’ll see how far you got.
