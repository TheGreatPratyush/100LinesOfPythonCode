## 📝 Vigenère Cipher Tool (Python)
A simple, powerful command-line tool to encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Vigenère cipher. It showcases a historical polyalphabetic cipher in under 100 lines of clean, PEP 8–compliant Python code.

## 🚀 Features
🔐 Encrypt any plaintext message with a secret keyword.
🔓 Decrypt ciphertext back to its original form using the same keyword.
🔄 Handles messages of any length by looping the keyword.
✍️ Preserves original character case and ignores non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation, numbers).

## 🧠 Highlights
Written in pure Python — no external libraries needed 🐍.
Under 100 lines of readable, well-commented code 💯.
Demonstrates:
String manipulation and dictionary lookups.
The power of modulo arithmetic for cryptographic wrapping.
Clean function design with clear parameters.
Following PEP 8 style guidelines.

## ⚙️ How to Run
Save the code as vigenere.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory.
Run the script:
Bash
python vigenere.py
The script will run a pre-defined example to demonstrate its functionality. You can easily change the message and keyword variables inside the file to test your own text! 🎯

## 💻 Example
Running the script produces the following output:

Original Message: Hello, World! This is a secret message.
Keyword: PYTHON
Encrypted Message: Gsmop, Fyrvj! Hmie si e wsqbch iawwegs.
Decrypted Message: Hello, World! This is a secret message.
